   cd calculator-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE calculator_db;
   USE calculator_db;
   
   CREATE TABLE calculations (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       expression VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       result VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       tag VARCHAR(50),
       created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. Update database configuration:
   - Open `server.js`
   - Update the database connection details if needed:
     ```javascript
     const db = mysql.createConnection({
         host: 'localhost',
